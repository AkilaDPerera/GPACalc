	<h2><strong>WELCOME TO THE BLOG,</strong><h2>
	<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	
	<div class=''>
		<p>
		This is a personal blog that is maintained by Akila Darshana Perera(myself). 
		This blog was initialized on August 2016. 
		The main purpose of this blog is to introduce myself to the people who are interested in knowing me.
		By looking around this site, you will be able to get some info about my personal background, professional qualifications, projects completed and contact details.
		Apart from that, you will be able to access my newly developped webapp called GPA calculator. 
		</p>
		<p>
		As a university student, I know that the most of students are interested in their Grade Point Average. 
		Whenever we are receiving our module grades first thing we are interested in, is to check how the newly known module grade affects to our current GPA.
		Although we can calculate it by hand, it is time consuming and need to remember the credits of each module.
		So I thought to make your life easier by developping this GPA calculater. Here I offer you two options.
		One is(not developped yet), you have to create an account and initialize your registered modules. Once you initialized, you can just go and check your GPA by putting your modules grades.
		The other way is, if you are a UoM student, you can put your username and password of your lms account. Then the GPA Calculator will go and extract your registered module details from lms and show them to you. 
		After the calculator has shown your the module details you just have to do is, filling the form using grades you earned and check your current GPA. This option is only for the students of UoM.
